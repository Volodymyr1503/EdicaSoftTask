# SimpleCalc

Owner - Volodymyr Broslavskyy.

To use the SimpleCalc you should:

1.Download this code or input "git clone ***** " in GitBash;
2.Open folder, where you cloned or downloaded the project;
3.Open file index.html;
4.Click "Open Calc";
5.Input your numbers and first double click on "Sum" or "Multiply"
6.BONUS - You can change row background by clicking on checkboxes.

To create this Simple Cal it was used Bootstrap 4, SCSS, JQuery.
There are two solutions for the Simple Calc - JQuery (rows background) and poor JavaScript code (Calculating).

Good bye,
